Statistics provided in the eKompendium of the HGIS project in RDF

This repository provides data derivations of time series data in the [HGIS eKompendium](http://www.ekomp.digihist.de/Dokumentation_Datensaetze/Zeitreihen/).

It serves as a showcase for the time series visualization capabilities of the SPARQL Unicorn Ontology documentation script.

## Data Origin

Even though no explicit data license is stated on the given homepage, we believe that the time series data are fact-based and free to use in a context like this.
If there are legitimate concerns by the HGIS project concerning this publication in this way, please contact us at qgisplugin@sparqlunicorn.link
